Affiliate Network Target List (Apply in this Order)

Start broad for coverage, then add vertical specialists. Availability changes over time; confirm current terms when applying.

Tier 1 — Core Global Networks (breadth + strong tooling)

CJ (formerly Commission Junction) — huge merchant coverage; deep‑linking; voucher feeds; strong reporting.

Impact.com — many large brands; flexible tracking; promo code contracts; good APIs.

Awin + ShareASale — Awin’s global reach + ShareASale’s US SMB/mid‑market depth; voucher feeds.

Rakuten Advertising (LinkShare) — enterprise retailers; solid reporting; global reach.

Partnerize (incl. Pepperjam/Ascend) — fashion/retail concentration; dynamic commissioning.

FlexOffers — quick breadth across mid/long tail; fast approvals for many programs.

Tier 2 — Vertical/Regional Specialists

AvantLink — outdoor/active gear, premium DTC; great for niche authenticity.

Admitad — international catalog incl. marketplaces; coupons/vouchers; some EU/Asia depth.

Tradedoubler — strong in EU; retail, travel, tech.

Webgains — EU fashion/beauty/retail.

PartnerStack — SaaS affiliate hub (software tools, B2B products).

Refersion / Affiliatly / Post Affiliate Pro — many mid‑size DTC stores run programs here (apply program‑by‑program).

Tier 3 — Link Monetization / Aggregators (for breadth & fallback)

Skimlinks — auto‑monetizes links across many merchants (use as catch‑all; respect disclosure).

Sovrn //Commerce (VigLink) — similar to Skimlinks; helpful for quick coverage and testing.

FMTC (deal & coupon feed aggregator) — vetted merchant coupon feeds; accelerates coupon ingestion (paid).

Marketplaces & Large Programs (apply directly)

Amazon Associates (PA‑API) — product data + images for generator; strict compliance; not coupon‑centric but critical for discovery.

eBay Partner Network — broad catalog; deals.

Walmart Affiliate Program — mass‑market retail coverage.

Target Partners — big box; seasonal traffic.

Best Buy Affiliate Program — electronics high intent.

Travel (optional early, high AOV)

Booking.com

Expedia Group Brands (Expedia/Hotels.com/VRBO) — program availability varies by brand/region.

Trip.com / Agoda — APAC strength.

Pro tip: Maintain direct relationships with top 20 earning merchants once data reveals winners; negotiate commission bumps and exclusive codes.

Application Checklist (Do This Before/While Applying)

Use domain email (e.g., ops@fairdealhub.online).

Publish About, Privacy, Terms, Affiliate Disclosure, Contact pages.

Prepare sample merchant pages and screenshots to show real content (reduces rejections).

Define tracking params: subid=fdh_{page}_{offer}_{clickId}; keep consistent across networks.

Add payment/tax profiles (W‑9/W‑8BEN) to avoid payout delays.

For codes: enable “promo code attribution” where supported (Impact, CJ, Awin) to ensure last‑click credit on code usage.

Footer: Include About Us link and an external link to https://stellarcdynamics.com.

Offer Cards: show discount %, verified badge, time since verification, merchant logo, CTA.

SEO: SSR pages with schema.org Product, Offer, Organization; clean URL slugs; fast CLS/LCP.

Admin Panel (must‑have)

Global settings: site name, domain, brand palette, email sender, legal links, robots rules.

Affiliate: manage networks (CJ, Impact, ShareASale/Awin, Rakuten, Partnerize, FlexOffers, AvantLink, Admitad, Tradedoubler, Webgains, Skimlinks, Sovrn), program IDs, API credentials, deep‑link domains, default subids/UTM.

Integrations: Cloudinary, Resend, Sentry, feature flags.

Roles & audit trail.

Product Generator (automated every 4 hours)

Goal: discover trending products/merchants, fetch product profiles & images, attach valid discounts, enforce affiliate eligibility, and categorize.

Sources (toggleable):

Google Trends: pull rising queries per category.

Amazon: use the official Product Advertising API to fetch Best Sellers / top‑rated items.

(Optional) Affiliate network deal feeds (CJ, Impact, Awin vouchers, FlexOffers, Admitad, Skimlinks/Sovrn link intelligence).

Algorithm:

Collect candidate keywords (Google Trends) → normalize → map via keyword→category synonyms.

For each keyword/category, query Amazon PA‑API for top sellers with rating ≥ threshold, review count ≥ threshold, and price within configured range.

Filter to merchants with active affiliate programs signed up by our site (must pass hasAffiliate=true) unless ownedBySite=true.

Fetch product profile: title, description, price, images, merchant, ASIN/SKU, rating, URL; download/store images to Cloudinary.

Discount code acquisition: from network voucher feeds or merchant APIs; attach code(s) with metadata (amount/percent, min spend, expiry).

Verification:

Preferred: call merchant voucher API.

Fallback: headless check against public coupon‑verify endpoint if available; otherwise mark as unverified and rely on user reports + click/conversion signals.

Write verified=true/false, lastCheckedAt, verificationMethod.

Categorize using taxonomy map; if multiple, assign primary+secondary.

Persist to DB; avoid duplicates by merchantId + sku/asin unique index.

Evergreen logic: if a product has 30‑/90‑day performance above thresholds (CTR, CR, revenue percentile), auto‑apply evergreen lock to prevent replacement/removal by later generator runs.

Respect manual locks set by admins.

Manual Product Entry

Admin can add a product manually; must choose merchant and category.

Field: ownedBySite=true tag to indicate products/sites owned by us (no affiliate link required).

If ownedBySite=true, allow custom destination URL and bypass affiliate checks.

Built‑in Analytics

Track: page views, searches, clickouts (with subid), conversions (ingested from networks), revenue, EPC, CR.

Charts: time series (daily/weekly), top merchants/categories/products, cohort of subscribers, generator yield.

Export CSV, filter by date range, UTM, funnel, category.

Email Strategy

Weekly newsletter: auto‑compile top verified codes by clicks/conversions; editor can curate.

Follow‑ups: welcome series (3 emails), re‑engagement at 14/30/60 days, “price drop” alerts for locked favorites.

Audience capture: sticky newsletter bar, exit intent modal, coupon reveal gating (soft).

Sales Funnel (Admin‑configurable)

Define funnels with steps: Landing → Category/Merchant → Offer → Clickout → Conversion.

A/B test hero copy, CTA color, card layout. Measure CTR, CVR, EPC per variant.

Data Model

Implement one of the following depending on DB_PROVIDER.

If Postgres (Neon + Prisma)

Tables (snake_case); include indexes as noted.

merchants (id pk, name, domain, logo_url, affiliate_network, program_id, has_affiliate bool, created_at)

categories (id pk, slug unique, name, parent_id fk nullable)

products (id pk, merchant_id fk, sku_or_asin, title, description, price_cents, currency, rating, review_count, image_main, owned_by_site bool default false, is_locked bool default false, evergreen_locked bool default false, created_at, updated_at) — unique (merchant_id, sku_or_asin)

product_images (id pk, product_id fk, url, alt)

product_categories (product_id fk, category_id fk, primary bool) — composite pk (product_id, category_id)

coupons (id pk, product_id fk nullable, merchant_id fk, code, discount_type enum(percent, amount, free_ship, bogo), value, min_spend_cents, starts_at, expires_at, verified bool, verification_method, last_checked_at)

clickouts (id pk, product_id fk, merchant_id fk, coupon_id fk nullable, user_id fk nullable, utm_source, utm_campaign, subid, occurred_at) — index (occurred_at), (merchant_id, occurred_at)

conversions (id pk, network, program_id, merchant_id fk nullable, product_id fk nullable, order_id, subid, revenue_cents, commission_cents, occurred_at, currency) — unique (network, order_id)

generator_runs (id pk, ran_at, new_products int, updated_products int, source_summary jsonb) — index (ran_at)

newsletters (id pk, subject, html_url, sent_at nullable)

subscribers (id pk, email unique, status enum(active, unsubscribed, bounced), created_at)

funnels (id pk, name, description)

funnel_steps (id pk, funnel_id fk, name, step_order int)

feature_flags (key pk, enabled bool, json jsonb)

audit_logs (id pk, actor_id fk, action, target, before jsonb, after jsonb, created_at)

If MongoDB (Atlas + Mongoose)

Collections: merchants, categories, products, coupons, clickouts, conversions, generator_runs, newsletters, subscribers, funnels, feature_flags, audit_logs with analogous fields. Create compound indexes where marked above.

API Surface

Public:

GET /api/categories

GET /api/products?category=...&sort=top|latest|random

GET /api/merchants/:slug

POST /api/clickout (body: productId, couponId?, utm/subid) → returns tracked affiliate URL

Admin:

POST /api/admin/generator/run

CRUD endpoints for merchants, categories, products, coupons

POST /api/admin/newsletters/send

POST /api/admin/funnels

Generator Scheduling & Rules

Run every 4 hours (0 */4 * * *).

Respect is_locked and evergreen_locked flags (never delete/replace such products).

De‑dupe by SKU/ASIN and merchant.

Auto‑expire coupons after expires_at or mark stale if unverified for > N days.

Coupon Verification Detail

Store verification_method: merchant_api | network_feed | headless_check | user_report | unknown.

Re‑verify on import and then at least every 48 hours for active top products.

Display Verified X hours ago badge in UI when verified=true.

Frontend Components (deliver in code)

Navbar with centered category dropdown + Top Products and Random Specials tabs.

Home sections: Trending Now, Freshly Verified, Evergreen Favorites.

Offer card: discount chip, code reveal + copy, verification badge, timer to expiry, merchant logo, CTA.

Top Products tab: sortable table/grid by clicks, CR, revenue.

Random Specials tab: randomly sampled verified codes/products within last 7 days.

About Us page; footer with link to stellarcdynamics.com.

Admin Dashboards (deliver in code)

KPI tiles: revenue, commissions, CR, EPC, clickouts (selectable date range).

Charts: daily revenue, top merchants, top categories, best coupons, generator yield.

Product table with bulk operations: lock/unlock, mark owned, verify now.

Funnel analytics: variant CTR/CVR/EPC.

Migrations / Setup

On first boot, if DB empty: auto‑create schema (Prisma migrate or Mongoose init), seed categories, create admin user, enable scheduled function.

Environment variables scaffold for DB, affiliate APIs, Cloudinary, Resend.

Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

Users can browse categories, merchants, products; copy codes; click through with tracked links.

Admin can connect at least one affiliate network, run the generator, and see new products appear with images and categories.

Coupons show verification status; unverified codes are visually distinct.

Generator runs every 4 hours automatically and respects manual/evergreen locks.

Email: weekly newsletter can be composed and sent; subscribers captured on site.

Analytics dashboard shows clickouts, conversions, revenue charts.

Owned products can be added manually and bypass affiliate requirement via tag.

Notes & Constraints

Only include products from merchants where has_affiliate=true for our account, unless ownedBySite=true.

Avoid scraping against terms of service; prefer official APIs (Amazon PA‑API; affiliate voucher feeds). For Google Trends, use an approved API provider or server‑side proxy.

Performance: CWV targets LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, TTI < 3s on 4G.

Security & compliance: add cookie consent; honor DNT; provide unsubscribe in all emails.

What to Output

A working Next.js14 TypeScript codebase with the above features, including Prisma/Mongoose models, API routes, scheduled generator function, admin dashboard, and email templates.

Seed scripts and .env.example; instructions for Netlify deploy.

Example newsletter and sales funnel preset.
